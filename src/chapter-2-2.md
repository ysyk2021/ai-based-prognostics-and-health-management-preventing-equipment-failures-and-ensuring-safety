Traditional approaches to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) have been used for decades and involve methods such as condition monitoring, reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and preventive maintenance (PM).

Condition Monitoring
--------------------

Condition monitoring is a method of PHM that involves monitoring equipment parameters such as temperature, pressure, vibration, and electrical signals to detect anomalies and diagnose faults. This method is ideal for identifying changes in equipment behavior that may indicate a potential problem. Condition monitoring can be done manually or automatically using sensors, and the data collected can be used to predict when maintenance or repairs are required.

Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM)
--------------------------------------

Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) is a systematic approach to identifying and prioritizing maintenance actions based on the criticality of each component and system. RCM involves analyzing the functions and performance requirements of each component or system, identifying potential failure modes, and determining the impact of each failure mode on equipment performance and safety. Maintenance actions are then prioritized based on the criticality of the component or system and the potential consequences of a failure.

Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
-----------------------------------------

Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is an analytical technique used to identify and evaluate potential failure modes and their impact on the system. With FMEA, potential failure modes are identified, and their likelihood and severity are evaluated. Mitigation strategies are then developed to reduce the risk associated with each failure mode.

Preventive Maintenance
----------------------

Preventive maintenance (PM) is a schedule-based approach to maintenance that involves performing maintenance tasks on a regular basis regardless of the equipment's actual condition. PM can include tasks such as lubrication, cleaning, and part replacement. This method can be effective in reducing unexpected failures, but can also lead to unnecessary maintenance and higher costs.

While these traditional methods have been widely used and can be effective in ensuring equipment reliability, they do have limitations. Traditional PHM approaches are often reactive, meaning maintenance actions are performed after a problem has already occurred or symptoms have begun to appear. Additionally, traditional methods rely on simplistic models that may not accurately reflect complex interactions between equipment components. Finally, traditional PHM approaches may struggle with limited data availability and integration issues when dealing with systems from multiple vendors or with different communication protocols.

However, these traditional methods can still be valuable tools for ensuring equipment reliability and safety, and can be complemented by AI-based PHM systems. In the next chapter, we will explore how AI techniques can be used to enhance traditional PHM approaches and overcome their limitations.
